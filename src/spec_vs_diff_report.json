  "summary": "The implementation successfully covers all 10 requirements from the BuildRequest. The backend Motoko actor implements the charging station data model, booking system with 30-minute slots, availability checking, and cancellation logic with 1-hour restriction. The frontend provides a complete user interface with station listings, calendar/time picker, booking flow, user dashboard, and Internet Identity authentication. The design uses green and electric blue color scheme (oklch(0.65_0.20_165) and oklch(0.75_0.18_155)) throughout. Both required images (ev-station.dim_800x600.png and eco-icon.dim_128x128.png) are referenced in the UI. No missing requirements or hallucinated features detected.",
